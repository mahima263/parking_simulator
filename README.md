## Parking simulator using JAVA(Using Concurrency and Multithreading)
Implementing an application simulating a parking area, with sensors that detect the following: when a car or a motorcycle enters or goes out of the parking area, an object to store the statistics of the vehicles being parked, and a mechanism to control cash flow.

Implement two version of the application: one without any synchronization mechanisms(Main.java), where we will obtain incorrect results, and one that works correctly(SynCarParking.jsvs) as it uses the two variants of the synchronized keyword.
